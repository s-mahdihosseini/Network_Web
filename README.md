## Summary
- A central bank cross-border liquidity line is an agreement between two central banks to
provide a collateralised loan of currency from one to the other. They have been around for
a long time, but have risen in prominence over the last twenty years. Following both the
great financial crisis and the pandemic, central banks expanded the number of lines and
relied on them to restore financial stability. By 2023, the funds committed to the liquidity
lines were well above the lending capacity of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

- These agreements are varied in their signatories and in their characteristics. For instance, while swap lines get most of the attention, there are many repurchase agreements
as well. Also, while borrowing from a line usually means money issuance by one of the
central banks, there are some large lines that instead lend out existing USD central bank
reserves. Finally, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has many bilateral lines, while the
Federal Reserve (Fed)’s lines are concentrated in one large multilateral arrangement, and
the European Central Bank (ECB) has a mix in between.

- This paper provides a comprehensive dataset of central bank cross-border liquidity
lines at the agreement level: by date and duration (2000-23), by source currency (USD,
EUR, RMB, others), by type (bilateral or multilateral), by funding structure (pooled or
by individual bank), by counterparties (central banks), and by some terms (like the collateral). This dataset was collated from public sources, and is freely available for other
researchers to use.2 We use these data to establish three novel sets of facts.
